Shortcuts
=========

.. py:currentmodule:: nsre.shortcuts

As everyone is lazy and there is some things that are very boring to do while
very easy to transform into a shortcut, here's the dedicated module.

Everything can be done directly with the :py:mod:`nsre.ast` module but it's
shorter with a shortcut.

.. automodule:: nsre.shortcuts
