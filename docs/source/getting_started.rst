Getting Started
===============

There is 3 main things in NSRE:

- :py:class:`nsre.regexp.RegExp` executes the regular expression
- :py:mod:`nsre.ast` helps you build them
- :py:mod:`nsre.matchers` provides some ways to match input tokens

You should start by having a look at the introduction of those three elements.

.. note::

    TODO write a real tutorial
